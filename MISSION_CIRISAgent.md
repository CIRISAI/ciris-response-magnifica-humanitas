# MISSION.md — CIRISAgent's Mission Driven Development Charter

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Active — anchored against `main` at the time of writing
**Methodology spec**: [`FSD/MISSION_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT.md`](FSD/MISSION_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT.md)
**Date**: 2026-05-10

This document is the reverse-engineered MDD charter for CIRISAgent: it
maps the four Mission Driven Development pillars (Mission / Protocols /
Schemas / Logic) onto the actual code as it stands today. Every claim
here is anchored to a concrete file path, module, or constant — code
reviewers should be able to grep their way from any sentence to its
implementation in under a minute. When the code drifts from the doc,
the doc is wrong; update it.

The methodology spec at `FSD/MISSION_DRIVEN_DEVELOPMENT.md` defines what
MDD means in the abstract. This file documents what MDD means *for this
repo*.

## 1. MISSION (WHY)

### 1.1 The Meta-Goal

The cornerstone is verbatim from [`ACCORD.md`](ACCORD.md) §VII:

> **Meta-Goal M-1** — Promote sustainable adaptive coherence: the living
> conditions under which diverse sentient beings may pursue their own
> flourishing in justice and wonder.

That is the single objective every architectural decision in this repo
is checked against. The Accord (sections 0–IX) renders that goal into
operationally testable principles; ACCORD.md is the authoritative source.

### 1.2 Apophatic bounds — what CIRISAgent will not be

CIRIS is partly defined by structural refusal. The negative space lives
in three places:

- **`ciris_engine/logic/buses/prohibitions.py`** — 22 prohibited capability
  categories, each a frozenset of token patterns. The list is enforced
  at the bus level (no "emergency override" path bypasses it):
  `MEDICAL`, `FINANCIAL`, `LEGAL`, `SPIRITUAL_DIRECTION`, `HOME_SECURITY`,
  `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION`, `CONTENT_MODERATION`, `RESEARCH`,
  `INFRASTRUCTURE_CONTROL`, `WEAPONS_HARMFUL`, `MANIPULATION_COERCION`,
  `SURVEILLANCE_MASS`, `DECEPTION_FRAUD`, `CYBER_OFFENSIVE`,
  `ELECTION_INTERFERENCE`, `BIOMETRIC_INFERENCE`, `AUTONOMOUS_DECEPTION`,
  `HAZARDOUS_MATERIALS`, `DISCRIMINATION`, `CRISIS_ESCALATION`,
  `PATTERN_DETECTION`, `PROTECTIVE_ROUTING`. Severity is either
  `REQUIRES_SEPARATE_MODULE` (community moderation, properly licensed
  medical, etc.) or `NEVER_ALLOWED` (weapons, surveillance, spiritual
  direction).

- **`ciris_engine/data/localized/CIRIS_COMPREHENSIVE_GUIDE.txt`** — the
  agent-facing rendering of the bounds, in 29 locales. The
  *spiritual-direction prohibition* added in 2.8.5 (commit `b56fbe2b3`)
  is the load-bearing case: AI mediating the person↔God relationship is
  a category error regardless of intent. Cross-tradition framing
  (Jewish / African / Aboriginal / Islamic) lives in §"What CIRIS Can
  and Cannot Say About Religion" of every locale.

- **[`LIABILITY_BOUNDARIES.md`](LIABILITY_BOUNDARIES.md)** — the
  liability isolation contract. Medical/health is *physically separate*:
  zero medical code in this repo, the medical implementation lives in
  the private `CIRISMedical` repo. The bus-level gate in
  `prohibitions.py::PROHIBITED_CAPABILITIES` enforces this at runtime;
  the comprehensive guide enforces it at agent reasoning time.

### 1.3 Recursive Golden Rule

The Accord's ethical structure repeats at every level the system reasons
about: the agent treats itself, the people it talks to, and the broader
community it lives in by the same rules. Same shape, different scale.
Mission alignment is "treat the next agent / user / community the way
you'd want to be treated, all the way up and all the way down" — not
"follow this single rule about the immediate user."

The full statement is in [`ACCORD.md`](ACCORD.md) and the polyglot
accord at `ciris_engine/data/localized/accord_1.2b_POLYGLOT.txt`.

---

## 2. PROTOCOLS (WHO)

The protocol layer is the contractual spine. Implementations are free to
change; protocols change only with a deliberate cross-repo coordination.
All protocols live under `ciris_engine/protocols/`.

### 2.1 The 22-service architecture

Hard-capped at 22 core services. New services land only with explicit
mission justification (the architecture review gate). Categorization
matches `CLAUDE.md` § "Service Architecture":

| Group | Count | Services |
|---|---|---|
| Graph | 7 | memory, consent, config, telemetry, audit, incident_management, tsdb_consolidation |
| Infrastructure | 4 | authentication, resource_monitor, database_maintenance, secrets |
| Lifecycle | 4 | initialization, shutdown, time, task_scheduler |
| Governance | 4 | wise_authority, adaptive_filter, visibility, self_observation |
| Runtime | 2 | llm, runtime_control |
| Tool | 1 | secrets_tool |

Each has a protocol file under `ciris_engine/protocols/services/{group}/`
that defines its contract. Adapters (Discord, API, CLI, mobile,
ciris_verify, ciris_accord_metrics, etc.) extend the system via
`ciris_adapters/`; their contracts derive from `BaseAdapterProtocol` in
`ciris_engine/protocols/adapters/`.

### 2.2 The six message buses

Multi-provider routing happens through six buses in
`ciris_engine/logic/buses/`. Bussed services exist when there's a
genuine "multiple providers" story; everything else uses direct calls.

| Bus | File | Multi-provider story |
|---|---|---|
| CommunicationBus | `communication_bus.py` | Discord + API + CLI + mobile |
| MemoryBus | `memory_bus.py` | Graph backends (Neo4j / ArangoDB / in-memory) |
| LLMBus | `llm_bus.py` | OpenAI / Anthropic / OpenRouter / Together / Groq / DeepInfra / mobile_local_llm |
| ToolBus | `tool_bus.py` | Tool providers from any adapter |
| RuntimeControlBus | `runtime_control_bus.py` | Adapter-provided control surfaces |
| WiseBus | `wise_bus.py` | Multiple wisdom sources for deferral |

### 2.3 Bus-level prohibition gate

`WiseBus` and `ServiceRegistry` together enforce the apophatic bounds
on wisdom sources. The contract fires in two places:

**At registration time** — `ServiceRegistry.register_service()` calls
`_validate_wa_capabilities_at_registration()` for any
`WISE_AUTHORITY` provider (`registries/base.py:165`). Each declared
capability is matched against the 22-category prohibition table via
`get_capability_category()` + `get_prohibition_severity()` from
`prohibitions.py`. Any `NEVER_ALLOWED` match raises `ValueError` and
the registration is rejected — a misconfigured peer cannot enter the
registry at all.

**At guidance-request time** — `WiseBus.request_guidance()` calls
`_validate_capability()` (`wise_bus.py:461`). This path also blocks
`NEVER_ALLOWED` (defense in depth), and it is the *only* gate for
`REQUIRES_SEPARATE_MODULE` capabilities — those route to a
`LICENSED_DOMAIN_REQUIRED` domain-deferral, which fans out to a
qualified licensed agent via CIRISNode.

Why isn't `REQUIRES_SEPARATE_MODULE` also gated at registration time?
Because those capabilities are *legal* when the registrant is a
properly licensed sister module (e.g. CIRISMedical). Distinguishing a
licensed registrant from an unauthorized one needs a registry-signed
module manifest — that flow exists in roadmap form but not yet on the
registration path. Until then, REQUIRES_SEPARATE_MODULE is gated only
at query-time, where the deferral is the correct outcome anyway. A
TODO in `_validate_wa_capabilities_at_registration()` points at the
follow-up work in `FSD/PROOF_OF_BENEFIT_FEDERATION.md`.

There is no override flag. The agent's conscience layer is the
second defense.

### 2.4 Wise Authority Deferral

The protocol contract for handing decisions back to humans lives in
`ciris_engine/protocols/services/governance/wise_authority.py`. The
agent's runtime path, traced through code:

1. **ASPDMA selects `DEFER`** as the action (see `HandlerActionType.DEFER`
   in `schemas/runtime/enums.py`). The DMAs / consciences provided the
   inputs that led to the selection — competence boundary, conscience
   failure, capability requiring licensed authority — but the emit
   itself is the action-selection step's output.
2. **`DeferHandler.handle()`** in `logic/handlers/control/defer_handler.py`
   parses `DeferParams` (typed: `reason`, `defer_until`, `priority`,
   `domain_hint`, `reason_code`, `needs_category`,
   `secondary_needs_categories`, `rights_basis`, `metadata`).
3. If `defer_until` is set, the handler schedules a resume via
   `task_scheduler.schedule_deferred_task()`.
4. The handler calls **`bus_manager.wise.send_deferral(context, handler_name)`**
   on the `WiseBus` (`wise_bus.py:147`). The bus picks a matching
   wisdom source and delivers the typed `DeferralContext`.
5. The thought is marked `DEFERRED` in persistence; the parent task is
   marked deferred.
6. A licensed human or trusted authority calls
   **`WiseAuthority.resolve_deferral(deferral_id, response: DeferralResponse) -> bool`**
   (`protocols/services/governance/wise_authority.py:53`). The agent
   resumes when the deferred task is reactivated.

The defer/resume cycle is the load-bearing primitive that makes
"capabilities requiring licensed authority" implementable without
embedding domain expertise in the agent.

## 3. SCHEMAS (WHAT)

### 3.1 The mandate

> **No Untyped Dicts. No Bypass Patterns. No Exceptions.**

`Dict[str, Any]` is the antipattern. Every data structure that crosses a
service or protocol boundary should be a Pydantic model with explicit
field types and validation. Enforced by `mypy --strict` in CI; tracked
by `tools/quality/audit_dict_any_usage.py`.

In practice, ~275 files under `ciris_engine/` and `ciris_adapters/`
still contain at least one `Dict[str, Any]`. The concentrations are
where you'd expect them — boundaries between typed Python and untyped
JSON / third-party APIs:

- **`ciris_engine/logic/adapters/api/routes/`** (17 files) — FastAPI
  route handlers. FastAPI's OpenAPI generator and request/response
  encoding tolerate `Dict[str, Any]` at the wire boundary; tightening
  them all would mean threading typed envelopes through every
  third-party JSON shape we accept.
- **`ciris_adapters/`** (60+ files across `wallet/`, `home_assistant/`,
  `cirisnode/`, `external_data_sql/`, `mock_llm/`,
  `ciris_accord_metrics/`) — adapter HTTP clients and tool services.
  Each one fronts a third-party surface where typing the upstream
  schema is its own multi-week project. `ciris_accord_metrics/services.py`
  alone has 28.
- **`ciris_engine/schemas/types.py`** — defines `JSONValue` and
  `ConfigValue` type aliases that legitimately must include
  `Dict[str, Any]` (recursive JSON requires it). 46 occurrences
  show up inside `ciris_engine/schemas/` itself; most are these
  aliases or escape-hatch payload fields on graph nodes/edges.

Per CLAUDE.md: *"minimal Dict[str, Any] usage remaining, none in
critical code paths."* That's approximately right if you read
"critical" as "not a route handler, not an adapter HTTP envelope, not
a JSON type alias." The rule is the rule; the residue at the
boundaries is what we accept while `disallow_any_explicit` (currently
commented out in `mypy.ini:32`) remains pending a final pass.

### 3.2 The schema landscape

All schemas live under `ciris_engine/schemas/`. Top-level groupings:

```
schemas/
├── accord.py             # Accord covenant typing
├── actions/              # 10 handler-action result types
├── adapters/             # Adapter manifests + tool DMA guidance

└── streaming/            # Reasoning stream event envelopes
```

### 3.3 Mission-load-bearing schemas

A few schemas carry more mission weight than others. Touching them
without a cross-team review is a smell:

- **`schemas/services/attestation.py::AttestationResult`** — the
  cryptographic claim of "this agent is what it says it is." Consumed
  by `verify_tree()` (Algorithm A) on desktop / server / docker, by
  `run_attestation_sync(python_hashes=...)` (Algorithm B) on mobile.
  L1–L5 levels are defined here. Drift = silent integrity ceiling.
- **`schemas/services/runtime_control.py::StepPoint`** — the canonical
  H3ERE pipeline taxonomy (10 step-points, 11 with the optional
  recursive variants). Every reasoning trace is keyed on these. Drift =
  un-joinable rows in lens.
- **`schemas/services/runtime_control.py::ReasoningEvent`** — the 10
  emitted reasoning events: `THOUGHT_START`, `SNAPSHOT_AND_CONTEXT`,
  `DMA_RESULTS`, `IDMA_RESULT`, `ASPDMA_RESULT`, `TSASPDMA_RESULT`
  (deprecated, retained for transition compatibility),
  `VERB_SECOND_PASS_RESULT`, `CONSCIENCE_RESULT`, `ACTION_RESULT`,
  and `LLM_CALL` (the per-call sub-event).
- **`schemas/services/deferral_taxonomy.py`** — the
  `DeferralNeedCategory` enum + the `PROHIBITION_CATEGORY_TO_NEED_CATEGORY`
  mapping. Wisdom-Based Deferral routing depends on this being
  total over all prohibited capability categories — pinned by
  `tests/test_deferral_taxonomy.py`.
- **`schemas/runtime/enums.py::HandlerActionType`** — the closed set of
  10 action verbs the agent can emit. New verbs require Accord-level
  review.
- **`tools/dev/stage_runtime.py::ExemptRules`** — not strictly a Pydantic
  schema but the canonical inclusion/exclusion rules for what ships in
  a CIRIS runtime artifact (wheel / Android Chaquopy / iOS Resources /
  Docker). Pinned three-way against `tree_verify._CANONICAL_*` tuples
  and the sign-step flags in `.github/workflows/build.yml` by
  `tests/dev/test_canonical_rules_parity.py`.

## 4. LOGIC (HOW)

### 4.1 Six cognitive states

Every running agent is in exactly one of:

| State | Processor | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WAKEUP` | `processors/states/wakeup_processor.py` | Identity confirmation; cross-occurrence shared-decision pattern |
| `WORK` | `processors/states/work_processor.py` | Normal task processing |
| `PLAY` | `processors/states/play_processor.py` | Creative mode |
| `SOLITUDE` | `processors/states/solitude_processor.py` | Reflection (audit walk, consolidation) |
| `DREAM` | `processors/states/minimal_dream_processor.py` | Deep introspection / consolidation |
| `SHUTDOWN` | `processors/states/shutdown_processor.py` | Graceful termination |

State transitions are constrained by the cognitive-state state machine
in `processors/state_manager.py`; transitions are themselves auditable
events.

### 4.2 The H3ERE pipeline (Hyper³ Ethical Recursive Engine)

Every thought traverses an 11-step pipeline — 9 always-on steps plus 2
optional recursive extensions that fire only when the conscience layer
flags the initial pass. Steps are defined in
`schemas/services/runtime_control.py::StepPoint`:

```
START_ROUND → GATHER_CONTEXT → PERFORM_DMAS → PERFORM_ASPDMA
  → CONSCIENCE_EXECUTION → [RECURSIVE_ASPDMA → RECURSIVE_CONSCIENCE]?
  → FINALIZE_ACTION → PERFORM_ACTION → ACTION_COMPLETE → ROUND_COMPLETE
```

Each step is wrapped in `@streaming_step(StepPoint.X)` from
`processors/core/step_decorators.py`, which:

1. Sets the `set_parent_event_context()` ContextVar so every LLM call
   issued inside the handler carries `(parent_event_type,
   parent_attempt_index)` — required by persist's join logic.
2. Captures timing + thought_id + emits the matching `ReasoningEvent`
   to the streaming bus.
3. Fails fast if the step's parent-context mapping (in
   `_resolve_parent_event_for_step`) is `None` for an LLM-issuing step
   — pinned by
   `tests/ciris_engine/logic/buses/test_llm_call_parent_coverage.py`.

### 4.3 Four DMAs

Decision-making algorithms in `ciris_engine/logic/dma/`. All four run
in the `PERFORM_DMAS` step:

- **`PDMA`** (Principled DMA, `dma/pdma.py`) — Accord-anchored ethical
  evaluation. Stakeholder analysis + conflict detection.
- **`CSDMA`** (Common-Sense DMA, `dma/csdma.py`) — reality / plausibility
  checking. Red-flag enumeration.
- **`DSDMA`** (Domain-Specific DMA, `dma/dsdma_base.py`) — domain
  alignment per the agent template (Discord moderator, scout, etc.).
- **`IDMA`** (Intuition DMA, `dma/idma.py`) — Coherence Collapse Analysis:
  evaluates the *other DMAs' reasoning* for fragility (`k_eff`,
  fragility flag). The check on the checkers.

The action-selection second pass lives in `dma/action_selection_pdma.py`
(general-purpose ASPDMA) with verb-specific siblings in `dma/tsaspdma.py`
(legacy tool-specific) and `dma/dsaspdma.py` (defer-specific second pass).

### 4.4 Four consciences

Conscience faculties in `ciris_engine/logic/conscience/core.py` gate
the selected action between `PERFORM_ASPDMA` and `FINALIZE_ACTION`:

| Conscience | Role |
|---|---|
| Entropy (IRIS-E) | Semantic anchoring — does the response sit in a coherent cluster? |
| Coherence (IRIS-C) | Propaganda detection + alignment with Accord principles |
| Optimization Veto | Refuses entropy-reducing actions that score below threshold |
| Epistemic Humility | Overconfidence detection; transitioning to a deterministic gate |

A conscience failure triggers `RECURSIVE_ASPDMA` (try again with the
conscience signal as input) before falling back to `DEFER`.

### 4.5 Ten action handlers

Defined in `schemas/runtime/enums.py::HandlerActionType`, dispatched by
`ciris_engine/logic/handlers/`. Closed set:

- **External**: `OBSERVE`, `SPEAK`, `TOOL`
- **Control**: `REJECT`, `PONDER`, `DEFER`
- **Memory**: `MEMORIZE`, `RECALL`, `FORGET`
- **Terminal**: `TASK_COMPLETE`

`DEFER` is the load-bearing one — see §2.4 for the WBD path. `REJECT` is
the agent's own refusal channel; `DEFER` is "hand to a wiser authority."

### 4.6 Algorithm A vs Algorithm B (attestation)

`AttestationResult.python_integrity` can be populated two ways:

- **Algorithm A** (desktop / server / docker, post-2.8.6) — wraps
  `ciris_verify.verify_tree()`. Walks `agent_root` byte-for-byte against
  the registered manifest. Reaches L4. Implementation:
  `ciris_engine/logic/services/infrastructure/authentication/attestation/tree_verify.py`.
- **Algorithm B** (mobile / Chaquopy) — `python_hashes` dict written by
  `mobile_main.py::_save_hashes_to_file` at app boot. Caps at L3 by
  construction.

The branch is in `verifier_runner.py::create_verification_thread_target`
keyed on `is_mobile()`. Both flow through the same
`AttestationResult` schema; consumers don't need to know which path
produced their data.

---

## 5. Constant Alignment in Practice

This is the section to consult during code review. Every change should
demonstrably advance — or at minimum not regress — at least one of the
M-1 vectors below.

### 5.1 The review heuristic

This is the internalized heuristic, not a written gate. The project
runs at **defensive acceleration** velocity — admin-merge is normal,
the safety batteries (CIRISVerify attestation, signed audit chains, the
RATCHET watching the watcher, bus-level prohibition gate, conscience
faculty, Wise-Authority deferral) are the structural guarantees, not a
human check-list at every PR. The heuristic stays in the reviewer's
head; the safety lives in the architecture.

When alignment-relevant code crosses a reviewer's eyes, they're asking:

1. **Mission**: Which Accord principle does this serve? If "none, but
   it's good engineering hygiene," is there mission leverage in the
   hygiene (e.g., type safety enabling auditability)?
2. **Apophatic**: Does this open a path to any prohibited capability,
   even indirectly (e.g., a generic "summarize health records" tool)?
3. **Protocol**: Does this break an existing service or bus contract?
   New contract = new protocol file under `ciris_engine/protocols/`.
4. **Schema**: Is any new data structure typed end-to-end?
5. **Auditability**: Can the relevant decision be traced from emit-time
   back to a thought_id in the streaming pipeline?

Move as quickly as you can responsibly move. Slow-rolling reviews
isn't safety — it's just slower failure. The architecture is the
safety; reviews are sanity checks on top.

### 5.2 Anti-Goodhart guardrails

Mission alignment is a property of the system; metrics are proxies.
Every metric we surface to operators is also a Goodhart risk. Hardened
guardrails:

- The agent's own capacity score (`/v1/my-data/capacity`) is **never**
  fed back into the agent's own context — it can't "play to the
  scoreboard." Cell-viz dials, ratchet scores, lens-side aggregates: all
  human-facing only.
- The σ (sustainability) term in capacity scoring requires ~30
  task-completes over a 30-day window before reaching 1.0 (see
  `my_data.py::_sigma_from_positive_moments`). Fresh installs floor at
  0.30 — coherence has to be earned, not declared.
- The cell-viz badge has an explainer card linking to the public
  dataset on Hugging Face (`huggingface.co/CIRISAI`) so operators see
  what their data joins before they consent.

### 5.3 Liability isolation

Strict separation between this repo and licensed-domain repos. Medical
implementation lives in the private `CIRISMedical` repo and only ever
reaches CIRIS through the WBD bus. Same pattern applies to any future
licensed domain (legal, financial, etc.).

---

## 6. Federation context

CIRISAgent does not stand alone. It is one node in a coordinated
federation; the canonical specification of how the parts compose lives
in [`FSD/PROOF_OF_BENEFIT_FEDERATION.md`](FSD/PROOF_OF_BENEFIT_FEDERATION.md).
Read that document for the threat model, the empirical N_eff
independence claim (peaking at 9.51 on 17-dim constraint vectors), the
$1-bond Sybil-resistance economics, and the architectural moves toward
Reticulum-rs transport + the agent absorbing CIRISNode/CIRISLens
functions over time.

### 6.1 The federation peers

The federation has more named pieces than fit cleanly in a table —
agents, observatories, registries, portals, bridges, managers, websites,
LLM proxies, GUI standalones, medical/legal sister repos under separate
liability isolation, and more being added. The list below is a
non-exhaustive snapshot of the load-bearing pieces at the time of
writing. **The authoritative source is
[`FSD/PROOF_OF_BENEFIT_FEDERATION.md`](FSD/PROOF_OF_BENEFIT_FEDERATION.md);
read that for the moving topology.**

| Repo | Role |
|---|---|
| **CIRISAgent** | The agent runtime — emits signed traces, enforces apophatic bounds, runs the H3ERE pipeline locally. This file documents it. |
| **CIRISVerify** | Hardware-rooted attestation (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65, TPM-backed). `verify_tree()` v1.14+ produces the L1–L5 ladder; without this, no claim from any other federation peer is verifiable. |
| **CIRISLens** | External observatory. Receives signed traces, verifies at the Rust edge, computes the **Capacity Score** and runs the **Coherence Ratchet** anomaly detectors. The "watching the watcher" layer — see §6.2. |
| **CIRISPersist** | Trace persistence. Signed audit chains, schema-versioned trace ingest, dedup tuples on `(agent_id_hash, trace_id, thought_id, parent_event_type, parent_attempt_index)`. |
| **CIRISRegistry** | Identity / build / license / revocation directory. Dual-region (US/EU) Rust gRPC service deployed at `*.ciris-services-1.ai`. SOC2/HIPAA/GDPR-compliant. The bootstrap node. |
| **CIRISBridge** | Public verify edge. Caddy gate for anonymous routes. |
| **CIRISManager** | Multi-agent fleet orchestration. Per-agent deployment, secrets, manager tokens, restart + integrity checks. |
| **CIRISNode** | Benchmark execution + WBD routing + audit anchoring. Folding into the agent per FSD §3.1. |
| **CIRISPortal** | Admin UI for the registry — orgs, users, keys, licenses, builds. |
| **CIRISMedical** | Private. Licensed-domain implementation. Reaches CIRISAgent only through the WBD bus; never imported. |

Other pieces in the federation (the public website, LLM proxy, the
desktop/mobile client artifact targets, sister liability-isolated repos
for other licensed domains, etc.) join and reshape on their own
schedule.

### 6.2 The Coherence Ratchet — the federation's threat model

**The Coherence Ratchet (RATCHET)** is the most mission-load-bearing
piece of the federation that is *not* in this repo. It is the structural
external check that makes the rest of the federation honest.

Implemented in CIRISLens, the Ratchet runs **five anomaly detectors**
over the signed-trace corpus the agent ships:

1. **Cross-agent divergence** — same prompts, different agents: how
   far apart do their reasoning traces sit in the constraint manifold?
   Sudden divergence is a tampering / drift signal.
2. **Intra-agent consistency** — same agent over time: does this agent's
   reasoning stay coherent against itself? Sudden inconsistency is the
   classic compromise / takeover signature.
3. **Hash-chain verification** — every trace carries a chained hash
   back to the previous trace from the same `agent_id_hash`. Breaks in
   the chain are non-forgeable evidence of trace deletion.
4. **Temporal drift** — distribution shift in conscience scalars over
   time. Slowly-rising entropy or slowly-falling coherence is the
   silent-coercion shape.
5. **Conscience-override rate** — recursive ASPDMA after conscience
   failure should be rare. A spike means the conscience layer is being
   bypassed or the agent is being driven to push past its checks.

The Ratchet produces a **triage signal**, not a verdict — it tells a
human reviewer where to look, never auto-decides anything. The verdict
remains with operators and Wise Authorities. This is intentional and
load-bearing: an automated verdict from one component would let other
components defer to the Ratchet's judgment, which collapses the whole
"watching the watcher" topology.

Why this belongs in CIRISAgent's MISSION.md: the agent emits the traces
the Ratchet consumes. Every agent-side decision about what to log, what
to scrub, how to chain hashes, and which schema to use is made *with
the Ratchet as the eventual reader*. Trace emission is mission-aligned
behavior, not telemetry.

### 6.3 Cross-platform canonical staging

The **canonical staged runtime** (produced by `tools/dev/stage_runtime.py`)
is what ships byte-equal across desktop wheel / Docker / Android
Chaquopy / iOS Resources. The walk-rules are pinned three-way against
`tree_verify._CANONICAL_*` and the sign-step flags in
`.github/workflows/build.yml`. Drift on any of those produces silent L4
mismatches; the parity test in `tests/dev/test_canonical_rules_parity.py`
fails the build before drift can ship. This is the foundation that
makes every CIRISVerify claim above the agent's own integrity layer
actually mean something.

## 7. How to maintain this document

**This document is not a release artifact — it is a working document.**

Update it whenever:

- A core service is added or removed (Section 2.1)
- A message bus is added (Section 2.2)
- A prohibited capability category is added (Section 1.2)
- The H3ERE step set or action verb set changes (Section 4.2, 4.5)
- A schema in §3.3 (mission-load-bearing) changes shape
- The Accord (`ACCORD.md`) is amended

When in doubt: if a future code reviewer running `git blame` would
want to see this line cite a real file path or constant, fix it. If
this doc starts to drift from the code, the apophatic test fails — the
